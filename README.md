# calculator
Created with JS, HTML, and CSS.
This calculator tool allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It supports keyboard input, as well.

My biggest challenge with this project was solving all of the edge cases that kept presenting themselves. For instance, what if the user presses two operators in a row, or what if the user presses equals before an operator is chosen? After fixing one bug, I'd try to crash or break the calculator in another way to find the next area to improve. The project significantly sharpened my use of pseudocode, debugging tools, and the developer console. I also appreciated the final bonus challenge of adding keyboard support which was great practice with event listeners.
